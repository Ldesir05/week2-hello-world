# my first program

print('Hello') # greats the user in english
print('What is your name?') # ask the user for their name
name = input()
print('Choose one of the three spoken languages') # wants the user to pick a language
print('Type \n1 Eniglish. \n2 French. \n3 Spanish.')
language = input() # grab user input
if language == '1': # if user input 1 program print's results
    print('Hello')
elif language == '2': # if user input 2 program print's results
